## Task 1:
Create a method called printLongestWord() that prints the longest of all the words in the text variable. 

Hints:
- Have it loop through each word in the ```text``` variable (see implementation of the two methods mentioned above for reference). 
- Have a counter that counts the length of each word and resets afterwards. 
- Have a String variable called "longestWord", that has its value overwritten in case of a longer word found. 
 

printWordsWithLessThanTwoVocals(); 

## Task 2: 
Create a method called printFirstHalfOfEachWord() that uses substring to print the first half of all words in the ```text``` variable. 

Hints: 
- Use the .substring() method along with the s.length


## Task 3: 
Create a method called printMostFrequentLetter() that prints the most frequent found letter in the ```text``` variable. 

The method must print both the actual letter as well as the times it occurred. 

Bonus for printing a top 10. 


## Task 4: 
Exactly the same as task 3 - but instead of _most_ frequent, then _less_ frequent. 
So create a method called printLessFrequentLetter(). 

again - bonus for printing top 10.
